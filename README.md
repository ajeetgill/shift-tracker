# Shift-Tracker

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, and run the development server:

```bash
npm ci
# process.env works without dotenv package & without NEXT_ prefix (in server side code)
# !!IMP : check .env.example on instructions about which variables
# you need to setup and naming convention
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Git, and everything else

For this, you'll need to connet your Github Account with your University provided email.
Also, if you're using an account made using University Email, make sure to add a secondary email (which can be your gmail/[proton-mail](https://proton.me/mail) account).
Basically have two email on your Github Accont (personal and university provided).
